      h4 Our kids need better mental health care.
      p
        |  The need for mental health care among youth is rising dramatically, but current care is difficult to access and frustrating to experience.  Rates of depression and suicide are growing rapidly in the United States, especially among adolescent females. Yet despite the growing rates of depression and suicide, youth are not getting adequate access to mental health services because of stigma, lack of awareness and unavailability of services, inconvenient access, and high cost of mental health services. Depression among college freshmen has increased 44% in the past 5 years and 57% among females in 4-year private institutions,

        |  70% of California adolescents aged 12-17 with Major Depressive Episode did not receive treatment,

      p
        .  SafeSpace Youth Mental Health Services is a non-profit organization founded by Stacy Drazan and Susan Bird.  Stacy and Susan are parents in the San Francisco Bay Area who have experienced first-hand the suffering that comes when a family is deeply impacted by mental health disease. In 2015, Stacy and Susan began searching the world for the leading experts and organizations focused on youth mental health. A visit to Australia to meet
        span.headspace headspace
        .  CEO Chris Tanti resulted in a friendship and agreement that Mr. Tanti would join Stacy and Susan on the SafeSpace Board of Directors. Mr. Tanti adds unparalleled experience, knowledge, and insight into the design and operation of the
        span.headspace headspace
        .  model in Australia as well as the successful translation of this model to countries such as Israel, Denmark, and Canada.  SafeSpace is dedicated to importing the
        span.headspace headspace
        |  model to the United States, focusing first on the Bay Area.
      p
        . Like

        .  in Israel, Denmark, Ireland and Canada, SafeSpace will enjoy full access to the look and feel, educational content, and care model of
        span.headspace headspace
        .  Australia.  Perhaps the most important benefit of importing the
        span.headspace headspace
        |  Australia model is that SafeSpace will begin on day one with an organizational model, marketing system, educational content, and care model that has been developed and validated for more than a decade in Australia and has been successfully imported to other countries outside of the United States.
      p  The key elements that will make SafeSpace so effective in addressing early stage mental health issues for youth are:
      ul
        li School-based awareness and involvement to drive early detection and treatment
        li Access to SafeSpace through an easy-to-access, online “single front door”
        li In addition to online care, SafeSpace will open a local clinic for in-person care
        li Every experience starts with a “warm welcome” therapy session
        li SafeSpace will coordinate with referral partners to provide acute care

      h3 School-based awareness and involvement will drive early detection and treatment.
      p A major obstacle to the early detection and treatment of mental health issues among youth is the lack of awareness and the inconvenience associated with finding and initially contacting a care provider.  We believe that the only effective means of addressing early stage youth mental health is to be present where youth are -- at school.  According to the Child Mind Institute 2016 Children Mental Health report, “One of the most important components of early intervention for behavioral and emotional health concerns is early identification.  School is the ideal place for this.”  School-based awareness and peer referral are key elements of the SafeSpace marketing strategy.  For that reason, identifying and nurturing highly supportive schools will be a major focus of our efforts.  SafeSpace will partner with local high schools who are intensely supportive of this effort.
      p
        . Students will lead the promotion of the service and provide feedback on the design of the service.  Broad involvement and sense of ownership among youth in served communities has had a major impact on the awareness and utilization of services in
        span.headspace headspace
        |  Australia and Israel, in particular. SafeSpace plans to mirror the proven student-involvement model used by these successful programs.
      p
        . Like
        span.headspace headspace
        | , SafeSpace will create a Youth Advisory board  that will provide local student clubs with a student club “playbook” that includes suggested charters, organizational structure, leadership roles, membership, meeting agendas, awareness and educational programs, fundraising, and financial management.  Two student representatives from each local school will be invited to participate in the advisory board.
      p  We believe that peers are often the first to notice changes in a friend beginning to suffer from mental health issues, and we plan to design our awareness and interaction model to facilitate peer-based referrals.  This will include educational materials that help peers identify the signs that a friend is struggling and a website and clinical engagement model that encourages and supports peers who contact SafeSpace in order to help a friend.
      p  In order to generate support among parents, SafeSpace plans to work with each school to create awareness at parent forums and in school-related communications with parents.
      p Starting with a program launch in August of 2017 and delivering care over the course of two academic years ending in June of 2019, our initial program aims to achieve:
      ul
        li 50% awareness among students at served schools
        li 75% of youth would recommend us to a friend in need
